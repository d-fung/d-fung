## Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm David, a software engineer in Toronto.

Currently, I'm working as an Integration Developer at University Health Network, where I build custom interfaces and ensure that millions of clinical messages reach their destination every day. 
Previously, I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Ontario Power Generation and helped create full stack analytic dashboards for the Trading team and
created models to predict energy pricing in Ontario and US regions.

I'm interested in the developments of both tech and health sciences, and have both a Bachelors in Software Engineering and Science (Spec. in Medical Sciences). I find the most enjoyment in building something that my friends and I use, and love to automate the boring stuff.

Outside of work, I stay active through volleyball, golf, and strength training. I’ve been an avid gamer since I was young, with League of Legends being a longtime favorite (since 2011). I also enjoy traveling and capturing moments on film.

Fun fact: my display picture was a photo taken by me at Fushimi Inari in Japan this year! ⛩️
